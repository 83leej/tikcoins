WARNING, This code is experimental and may contain flaws.

Designed mainly to see the coins spent on any live stream, tracks the current top 99 users

## Usage
install the extension in developer mode then visit a tiktok live stream. Once you have visited a live stream you need to activate the plugin to start monitoring by clicking the icons popup and clicking start session.
Once a session is started u can now click to see top contributors to the live stream, click this which will start the live feed process and calculating incoming data.

view settings page of the plugin to export your current data.

## Requirements
 logged in tiktok account
 chrome browser
 decent computer to handle large amount of store data

## TODO

to add feature to monitor various live streams at the same time
to add better exports for xml, csv
get ready for chrome extensions public release
fix error where once a webrequest is discovered and reactivated by the extension it gets stuck in a constant loop which ends up overloading the browser.
